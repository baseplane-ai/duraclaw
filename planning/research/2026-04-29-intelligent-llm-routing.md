# Research: Intelligent LLM Routing for Duraclaw

## Context

User asked to scope intelligent model routing in duraclaw. Today, model selection is **set once per session at spawn** and never changes. This wastes capacity (Opus on tasks Haiku could do), prevents budget enforcement, and leaves no surface for "spend $X on this task" semantics. Primary routing signal: **cost/latency budget** (per user request — not classification, not embedding similarity).

Research mode `RE-8704-0429`. Five parallel deep-dives:

1. Duraclaw current state — model selection
2. Claude Agent SDK model API capabilities
3. Cost/latency budget routing patterns (10 surveyed)
4. Prior-art libraries and services (9 surveyed)
5. Duraclaw telemetry & feedback signals

## Scope

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Map current model-selection surface | `cmd.model` flows orchestrator → runner → SDK; locked per session |
| Catalog SDK routing capabilities | Per-call init override ✅, mid-`query()` switch ❌, subagent override ✅, budget cap ✅ (already wired but unused) |
| Survey routing patterns | 10 patterns; winner: reactive escalation + predictive budget pacing + tier-table heuristic |
| Survey routing libs/services | 9 evaluated; verdict: build custom, steal from RouteLLM/LiteLLM patterns |
| Audit telemetry gap | Cost & duration per-session present; per-turn breakdown + cache tokens + project rollups missing |

## Findings

### 1. Current state — model selection in duraclaw

**Selection is per-session, set at spawn, immutable for session lifetime.**

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| UI (`settings.tsx:38–50`) | Hardcoded catalog `claude-{opus-4-7,opus-4-6,sonnet-4-6,haiku-4-5}` and Codex `gpt-5.1`/`gpt-5.4`/`o4-mini` |
| D1 (`migrations/0008,0025`) | `user_preferences.model` (Claude), `.codex_model` (Codex). Defaults `opus-4-6` / `gpt-5.1` |
| Spawn form (`SpawnAgentForm.tsx:53`) | Per-spawn override; default `opus-4-6` |
| DO (`rpc-lifecycle.ts:88,132,194,252`) | Stamps `cmd.model` onto `SessionMeta.model` and `agent_sessions.model` |
| Runner (`claude-runner.ts:606`) | `if (cmd.model) options.model = cmd.model` → SDK locked for session lifetime |

**Key inconsistencies (low-cost cleanup):**
- `useUserDefaults` localStorage default `opus-4-7` vs D1 schema default `opus-4-6` (`use-user-defaults.ts:7` vs `0008_replace_user_preferences.sql:32`)
- Identity is **orthogonal** to model (identity = HOME credential; not a model selector)
- Sub-agents inherit parent model implicitly (no SDK config exercising `AgentDefinition.model`)
- `max_budget_usd` is wired in shared-types and runner (`claude-runner.ts:610`) but **no UI to set it** — silent dead code

```
Current data flow:
  User Settings ──PUT /api/preferences──▶ D1 user_preferences.model
                                              │
   Spawn form ─cmd.model─▶ DO ─SpawnConfig.model─▶ Gateway
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                               Runner: options.model = cmd.model
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                                  SDK query()  ◀── locked
```

### 2. Claude Agent SDK capabilities (v0.2.119, pinned in session-runner)

| Capability | Available? | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Per-call model override at `query()` init | ✅ string only, not a function | `claude-runner.ts:606`, `shared-types/index.ts:41–94` |
| Mid-session switch within a single `query()` | ❌ | `docs/integrations/claude-agent-sdk.md:27`; SDK design |
| Sub-agent per-agent model (`AgentDefinition.model`) | ✅ | [Subagents docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents) |
| `total_cost_usd` event | ✅ | `SDKResultMessage.total_cost_usd` |
| `usage` event with input/output/cache tokens | ✅ all 4 fields emitted | SDK type defs |
| `modelUsage` per-model breakdown when subagents differ | ✅ | SDK type defs |
| `maxBudgetUsd` (SDK auto-aborts on overrun) | ✅ already wired | `claude-runner.ts:610` |
| Hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.) | ✅ — but **cannot mutate model** mid-stream | [Hooks docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks) |
| Cross-vendor (Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry) | ✅ via env vars | SDK overview |
| Non-Anthropic vendors (Gemini, GPT) directly | ❌ would bypass SDK entirely | — |

**Implication.** Inside an active `query()`, the only mid-session "routing" lever is **subagent dispatch**. The clean surfaces are:

- **Pre-flight (orchestrator)** — pick the model when the DO calls `triggerGatewayDial`
- **Subagent registry** — declare typed subagents with `{ name, model }` and let Claude delegate

Hooks help with budget *guardrails* (deny tool calls) but not with model *selection*.

### 3. Routing patterns surveyed (10)

Full survey in deep-dive notes; ranking for **agentic, multi-turn coding on a cost/latency budget**:

| # | Pattern | Complexity | Cost savings | Agent fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reactive escalation on tool-call/schema failure** | Heuristic | 60–80% | **Very high** (agent-native) |
| 2 | **Predictive budget pacing** (track session burn, downshift before overrun) | Heuristic→learned | 70–85% | **Very high** (Nemotron-Cascade 2 validated) |
| 3 | Confidence-escalation cascade (FrugalGPT, RouteLLM) | Learned scorer | 60–70% | High |
| 4 | Tier-table heuristic | Trivial | 60–80% | Moderate (brittle on boundaries) |
| 5 | Unified cascade-routing (de Koninck et al., ICML 2025) | DP optimizer | 65–75% | High (SWE-Bench +14%) |
| 6 | Multi-signal confidence (semantic + layer convergence + learned) | Learned predictor | 55–65% | Moderate (high overhead) |
| 7 | LLM-as-router (tiny dispatcher) | Tiny classifier | 50–70% | Moderate (amortization risk) |
| 8 | Latency-aware SLO routing (SCORE, SOLA) | Constrained opt | Cost secondary | Moderate |
| 9 | OmniRouter (batch global optimization) | DP / Lagrangian | 65–75% | Low (batch ≠ sequential) |
| 10 | Speculative decoding cascade | System-level | 10–20% (latency only) | Low for routing |

Sources: [FrugalGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05176), [RouteLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665), [Unified Cascade-Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10347), [OmniRouter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20576), [Token-Budget-Aware Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.09613), [Nemotron-Cascade 2](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/nemotron-cascade-2/).

**Winning combination for duraclaw:** tier-table (P0 baseline) → predictive budget pacing (P3) → reactive escalation (P4) → learned classifier (P5).

### 4. Prior-art libraries surveyed (9)

| Lib | Type | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| RouteLLM | OSS, Apache 2 | **Steal patterns** | BERT/MF preference classifier; ~85% cost reduction on MT-Bench. Python-only; would need TS port |
| LiteLLM Router | OSS, MIT | **Steal patterns** | Per-key budget, latency p50/p95 tracking, fallback chains. Python-first, Node SDK secondary |
| Anyscale routers | OSS research | **Steal patterns** | RL-trained router (bandit formulation); generalizes across model pairs |
| Portkey | OSS + managed | **Wrap (lite)** if scaling | Native Anthropic; cost & latency guardrails. Adds latency, requires deps |
| OpenRouter | Managed | Skip | OpenAI-API drop-in; bypasses SDK |
| NotDiamond | Managed SaaS | Skip | OpenAI-API middleware; breaks Agent SDK loop |
| Martian | Managed SaaS | Skip | Same as above |
| Helicone | OSS + managed | Skip | OpenAI-SDK wrapper; observability-first |
| Vercel AI SDK | Framework | Skip | Different abstraction; doesn't help Agent SDK case |

**Verdict: build custom.** Every external service either wraps the chat-completions API (forcing us out of `claude-agent-sdk`, defeating its purpose) or runs as a Python sidecar (incompatible with Bun + CF Workers in-process). RouteLLM and LiteLLM offer the *patterns* to steal; the implementation is ~500 LOC TypeScript inside the orchestrator.

### 5. Telemetry & feedback gap

Cost and duration are captured **at session aggregate** today, mostly via SDK delegation:

| Signal | Present? | Where? | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-turn `total_cost_usd` | ✅ session-level only | `agent_sessions.total_cost_usd`, accumulated in `gateway-event-handler.ts:580` | No per-turn rows; only the running sum |
| Per-turn `duration_ms` | ✅ session-level only | `agent_sessions.duration_ms` (`claude-runner.ts:1051`) | Wall-clock only; no breakdown (gate wait vs. SDK exec) |
| `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` | ✅ in `context_usage_json` blob | `WireContextUsage` (`shared-types:849`); UI status-bar | Not normalized columns; not per-turn |
| `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens` | ❌ **not extracted** | — | SDK emits them; runner ignores |
| Time-to-first-token | ❌ | — | Would need partial-event timestamp |
| Project-level cost rollup | ❌ | — | Would need D1 view or new table |
| Identity-level cost rollup | ❌ | — | GH#119 P3 tracks identity but not cost |
| Codex/Gemini cost | ❌ adapters return `null` | `codex.ts:266`, `gemini.ts:321` | Need pricing tables or vendor-emitted cost |
| `[router:*]` log tags | ❌ | — | Add to `event_log` for audit trail |

**No `[cost]`/`[tokens]` log tags exist.** Logging discipline (`docs/theory/topology.md:51`) reserves prefixes `gate`, `conn`, `rpc`, `reap`, `failover`, `error`. A router would add `router:budget`, `router:decision`, `router:escalate`.

## Comparison: Where can the router live?

| Locus | Granularity | Reach | SDK compatibility | Build cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Orchestrator pre-flight** | Per-session | New sessions | Native — `cmd.model` already wired | S | ✅ **MVP** |
| **Subagent dispatch** | Per-subagent | Within session | SDK-native via `AgentDefinition.model` | M | ✅ **Phase 2** |
| Session-runner per-turn | Per-turn within `query()` | Within session | ❌ Not supported by SDK | — | Skip |
| Cross-vendor proxy | Any | All sessions | Breaks SDK agent loop | XL | Skip |
| Resume-and-respawn for escalation | Per-turn (coarse) | Within session | Workable but loses context mid-resume | M | Phase 4 fallback |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P0 — Budget at the door)

Smallest, highest-leverage move: **expose `max_budget_usd` in the UI and tie it to a tier preset**. The SDK already enforces the cap. No router logic, no telemetry expansion — just plug a switch into a dead-coded surface.

- Add a "Budget" field to `SpawnAgentForm` (`SpawnAgentForm.tsx`) and `settings.tsx` defaults
- Add tier presets: `cheap → haiku-4-5 + $0.25 cap`, `balanced → sonnet-4-6 + $1.00 cap`, `premium → opus-4-7 + $5.00 cap`, `unlimited → opus-4-7 + null`
- Reconcile the `opus-4-7` vs `opus-4-6` default mismatch (`use-user-defaults.ts:7` vs migration `0008`)
- D1 schema: add `agent_sessions.budget_usd_cap`, `user_preferences.default_budget_usd_cap`

**Effort:** ~1–2 days. **Reach:** every new session has a hard ceiling. **No** SDK changes; **no** new telemetry; **no** routing logic yet.

### Near-term (P1 — Per-turn telemetry)

Required before predictive pacing or cascading work. Without per-turn rows, you can't compute burn rate or train a classifier.

- Extract `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from SDK `usage` events
- Add a `session_turns` table or per-turn JSON array on `agent_sessions` capturing: `{turn_id, model, input_tok, output_tok, cache_create_tok, cache_read_tok, cost_usd, duration_ms, ts}`
- Surface session cost + duration in `status-bar.tsx` (currently only context tokens)
- Add `[cost]` log tag and emit `logEvent('info','cost', …)` per turn in DO

**Effort:** ~3–5 days.

### Phase 2 (Subagent tier dispatch)

Inside a session, route work via typed subagents. SDK-native, no resume/respawn dance.

- Define `agents` config with at minimum: `{ summarizer: 'haiku', coder: 'sonnet', architect: 'opus' }`
- System prompt: instruct main loop (Sonnet) to delegate by task shape
- Each subagent inherits its declared model; SDK handles dispatch

**Effort:** ~1 week. Real cost savings (RouteLLM-class) once Claude is steered to delegate cheap work.

### Phase 3 (Predictive budget pacing — DO-side)

Once per-turn telemetry exists, the DO can downshift the *next spawn* in a project:

- For each project, compute burn rate `cost_usd / time_window`
- If burn rate > budget pace, downgrade subsequent spawns one tier (Opus → Sonnet → Haiku) and shorten budget caps
- Surface budget overruns in UI as warnings (then hard-stop on cap)

**Effort:** ~1 week. **Risk:** late-session quality drop; mitigated by reserving 20–30% of budget for high-stakes turns (per FrugalGPT pattern).

### Phase 4 (Reactive escalation)

When Haiku spawn returns failure (schema validation, tool-call error, low-confidence signal), orchestrator re-spawns with Sonnet via `resume`. Coarse but workable — the only intra-session escalation path the SDK supports without losing context entirely.

### Phase 5 (Learned classifier)

Once we have ~1000 labeled session-turn rows, train a RouteLLM-style preference classifier (BERT or matrix-factorization). Predicts: "would Haiku have produced an equivalent answer?"

## Open questions (to resolve before P0 spec)

1. **Budget unit** — per-session $ cap, per-day $ cap, per-project $ cap, or all three? (Affects D1 schema)
2. **Project-level vs. user-level budget** — does the budget travel with the project (multi-user share a pot) or with the user (cross-project)? Project-level + user-level are not mutually exclusive but multiply schema work
3. **Multi-vendor scope** — Codex and Gemini adapters exist (`codex.ts`, `gemini.ts`) but emit `null` cost. Do we extend routing to them in P0 (requires per-vendor pricing tables) or stay Claude-only?
4. **Default policy for unbudgeted sessions** — hard cap at $X, soft warn-then-cap, or unlimited (current behavior)? Recommend "soft warn at $1, hard cap at $10" as a starting default
5. **Identity coupling** — should different identities have different default models / budgets (e.g., personal-account identity gets Sonnet + $5; team identity gets Opus + $25)? GH#119 P3 didn't model this
6. **Escalation trigger semantics for P4** — exit code from runner? SDK `usage`-derived signal? Custom user feedback button? Different triggers imply very different infra

## Next steps

1. Decide on the open questions above (informal interview, then create issue)
2. Open a GitHub issue: **"Intelligent LLM routing — P0: budget at the door"** as a feature spec, link this research doc
3. Schedule planning mode for the P0 spec
4. Telemetry expansion (P1) can run in parallel with P0 — no dependency

## Addendum — Bind routing to kata modes (and the kata arc)

**User pivot:** "build it into the kata arc process so that certain modes are fixed to certain models."

This reframes the recommendation. The original P0 was a generic UI tier preset (`cheap / balanced / premium`). But duraclaw already has a **better task classifier** that the user explicitly opts into every session: the **kata mode**. Modes encode *cognitive load and intent* by design (planning vs. task vs. verify is precisely a complexity gradient). Binding model + budget to mode eliminates the need for inference-time classification — the user's mode choice **is** the routing decision.

### Why the kata-mode locus wins for P0

- **Already a task type signal.** `kata enter <mode>` is the user declaring "this is research" or "this is debug." That's the signal a learned classifier would otherwise have to infer.
- **Already a session-scoped boundary.** Each kata session maps to one or more spawned sessions; SDK constraint (model locked per `query()`) is satisfied without contortion.
- **Already plumbed.** Kata reserves worktrees via the orchestrator (`packages/kata/src/commands/enter.ts:748–751`). Adding `{ model, max_budget_usd }` to the mode config YAML and to the reserve payload is mechanical; the receiving end (orchestrator `cmd.model`, `cmd.max_budget_usd`) already exists.
- **Already declarable in YAML.** Mode config is Zod-schema'd at `packages/kata/src/config/kata-config.ts:13–37`, sourced from `.kata/kata.yaml` (with `packages/kata/batteries/kata.yaml` as fallback). Two new optional fields on `KataModeConfigSchema` and we're done.
- **Arc-level budgets are natural.** "Arc" in this repo = an issue-anchored multi-session work unit (`packages/kata/src/lib/reserve-worktree.ts:34` — `ReservedBy.kind = 'arc'`). A budget on the arc draws across all its sessions, which is what users actually want ("don't spend more than $X solving this issue").

### Proposed per-mode defaults

Anchored to cognitive load, with budgets matched to typical session length:

| Mode | Default model | Budget cap | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `freeform` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | $0.25 | Quick Q&A; low cognitive load |
| `verify` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | $0.50 | Mechanical VP execution; high volume of small steps |
| `task` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | $1.50 | Small refactor/fix; needs reasoning but tightly scoped |
| `debug` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | $3.00 | Hypothesis-driven; may need to escalate to Opus on hard cases |
| `research` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | $5.00 | Parallel Explore agents; main loop is synthesis, agents are reads |
| `implementation` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | $10.00 | Executing an approved spec; design is already done |
| `planning` | `claude-opus-4-7` | $5.00 | Architectural reasoning; the one mode where Opus pays back |

Three principles behind the table:
1. **Opus is reserved for design** (`planning`) — by the time you're in `implementation`, the hard thinking is done
2. **Haiku for mechanical/conversational** (`freeform`, `verify`) — these are high-volume, low-stakes
3. **Sonnet is the workhorse middle** — most modes default here

### Schema sketch

```yaml
# .kata/kata.yaml (and packages/kata/batteries/kata.yaml)
modes:
  planning:
    template: planning.md
    model: claude-opus-4-7         # NEW
    max_budget_usd: 5.0            # NEW
    rules: [...]
  implementation:
    template: implementation.md
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6       # NEW
    max_budget_usd: 10.0           # NEW
    rules: [...]
  task:
    template: task.md
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6       # NEW
    max_budget_usd: 1.5            # NEW
  # ... etc
```

```ts
// packages/kata/src/config/kata-config.ts (Zod schema extension)
export const KataModeConfigSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields
  model: z.string().optional(),               // NEW
  max_budget_usd: z.number().positive().optional(),  // NEW
})
```

### Resolution order

When a session spawns inside a kata mode:

```
session_max_budget_usd  ←  user-provided override on `kata enter` (--budget=X)
                       ↑
session_model           ←  user override on `kata enter` (--model=X)
                       ↑
                       ←  arc budget remaining / N expected sessions  (predictive pacing layer)
                       ↑
                       ←  mode default (kata.yaml)
                       ↑
                       ←  user-preference default (D1 user_preferences)
                       ↑
                       ←  hard system default
```

Most users get the right model + budget for free. Power users override per-session via flags. Arcs hard-cap the total spend.

### Revised phasing

P0 reshapes around kata-mode binding. The original P0 (UI tier presets) becomes redundant — modes *are* the tiers.

| Phase | What ships | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **P0a — Mode → model binding** | `model` + `max_budget_usd` on `KataModeConfigSchema`; thread through `kata enter` → worktree reserve → DO `cmd.model` / `cmd.max_budget_usd` | Wires the existing dead-coded budget cap and replaces hardcoded `opus-4-6` defaults with mode-aware ones |
| **P0b — Per-session overrides** | `kata enter <mode> --model=X --budget=Y` flags | Power-user escape hatch |
| **P0c — Arc budget cap** | Arc-level budget that aggregates across its sessions; track in D1 | "Don't spend more than $X on this issue" |
| **P1 — Per-turn telemetry** | (unchanged from original plan) Extract cache tokens, per-turn rows, surface in UI | Required for any predictive/learned routing |
| **P2 — Subagent tier dispatch** | (unchanged) `AgentDefinition.model` for typed subagents within a session | Cheap subagents inside expensive modes |
| **P3 — Predictive arc pacing** | DO downshifts subsequent spawns when arc burn rate exceeds budget pace | Project-/arc-level safety |
| **P4 — Reactive escalation** | (unchanged) Failed Haiku spawn → re-spawn with Sonnet via `resume` | Quality floor |
| **P5 — Learned classifier** | Per-mode classifier that tunes the *intra-mode* routing (e.g. is this `task` actually trivial enough for Haiku?) | Optimization on top of the binding |

### Open questions (additional to the original six)

7. **Per-arc vs. per-mode budget composition** — does a `planning` session inside a $20 arc still get its $5 mode cap, or is the arc cap the only ceiling?
8. **Override surface** — flags only (`--model`, `--budget`), env vars, or also a per-project `.kata/overrides.yaml`?
9. **Backfill** — should we use this opportunity to deprecate the global `user_preferences.model` default in favor of mode-specific defaults? (Cleaner mental model, but existing UI breaks)
10. **Identity coupling** — different identities (e.g. personal vs. team Claude account) may have different budget profiles. Do mode defaults compose with identity defaults, or is identity-level orthogonal?
